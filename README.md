# ShopMate

## Usage:

I was not yet able to deploy the site anywhere, so is how to deploy it.

### Api server
Download the [API server](https://github.com/simonadamgyula/shoppingListApi).  
The api server uses a postgresql database. You need to get one before starting. I recommend [Supabase](https://supabase.com).   
Run *Start.bat* file in the executables folder.  

### Web server
In the main directory of this project run ``` npm run build ``` than run ``` npm run start ``` to start the website.
