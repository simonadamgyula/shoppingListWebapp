# ShopMate

## Usage:

I was not yet able to deploy the site anywhere, so here is how to deploy it.

### Api server
1. Download the [API server](https://github.com/simonadamgyula/shoppingListApi).  
2. Usage in the api repositiory.  

### Web server
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Set your api url in the ```.env``` file.  
3. Run ``` npm run dev ```. ( ``` npm run build ```, ``` npm run start ``` doesn't work for some reason, I will try to fix it, but avoid using it at the moment! )
